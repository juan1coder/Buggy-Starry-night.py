# Buggy-Starry-night.py

Welcome to "Buggy Starry Night," a Python script designed to generate unique images where the buggy skies are the limit. This script prompts the user for a main idea, and then asks for an emotion to infuse into the generated image. If no input is provided, random ideas and emotions will be used.

While the main ideas are included in the script, feel free to contribute more artists to the list. Currently, the focus is on abstract expressionism, pop art, and 2D Japanese artists from the ukiyo-e art style.

We encourage you to explore, remix, sell, and share your art creations. Happy hacking! Feel free to make improvements and corrections to the script and its grammar. Let's create something amazing together!
